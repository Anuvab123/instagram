Frameworks and Languages Used
-
This project was built using the following frameworks and languages:

Spring Boot: Spring Boot is a popular Java framework for building web applications. It provides a simple and easy-to-use approach to building web applications, and is widely used in industry.

Java: Java is a widely used programming language that is commonly used for building web applications. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and cross-platform compatibility.

Spring Data JPA: Spring Data JPA is a framework that simplifies the development of database-driven applications. It provides a set of common APIs that can be used to access a variety of databases, and is widely used in Spring Boot applications.

Hibernate: Hibernate is a widely used ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for Java. It simplifies the process of mapping Java objects to database tables, and is widely used in Spring Boot applications.

MySQL: A popular open-source relational database management system, used as the database for this application.

Data Flow
-
The Instagram Project follows a typical data flow for a web application. The user interacts with the application through the user interface, which is rendered using Thymeleaf templates. When the user submits a form or clicks a button, an HTTP request is sent to the server, which is handled by a controller. The controller processes the request, retrieves or updates data from the database using the service layer, and returns a response to the user.

The Instagram Project uses several functions to handle the data flow and perform the necessary operations. Here are the main functions used in the application:

UserController: This controller handles all user-related requests, such as registering a new user, logging in, and logging out. It interacts with the UserService to perform the necessary operations.

UserService: This service layer handles user-related business logic, such as checking if a user exists, creating a new user, and updating user information. It interacts with the UserRepository to perform database operations.

UserRepository: This repository layer handles all database operations related to users, such as saving a new user, retrieving a user by ID, and updating user information.

PostController: This controller handles all post-related requests, such as creating a new post, retrieving a list of all posts, and deleting a post. It interacts with the PostService to perform the necessary operations.

PostService: This service layer handles post-related business logic, such as creating a new post, retrieving a list of all posts, and deleting a post. It interacts with the PostRepository to perform database operations.

PostRepository: This repository layer handles all database operations related to posts, such as saving a new post, retrieving a list of all posts, and deleting a post.
